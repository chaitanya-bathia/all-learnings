                <p class="text-xl text-justify">The Kankaria Lake, built in 1451 AD, is one of the biggest lakes in Ahmedabad. In earlier days, it was known by the name Qutub Hoj or Hauj-e-Kutub. Lal Bahadur Shastri lake in Bapunagar is almost 136,000 square metres. In 2010, another 34 lakes were planned in and around Ahmedabad of which five lakes will be developed by AMC; the other 29 will be developed by the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA). Vastrapur lake is a small artificial lake located in the western part of Ahmedabad. Beautified by local authorities in 2002, it is surrounded by greenery and paved walkways and has become a popular leisure spot for the citizens. Chandola Lake covers an area of 1200 hectares. It is home for cormorants, painted storks and spoonbills. During the evening time, many people visit this place and take a leisurely stroll.</p>

                <p class="text-xl text-justify">Sabarmati Ashram is a peaceful abode on the banks of Sabarmati River. As a place which witnessed the initiation of many freedom movements and where Mahatma Gandhi spent some of his notable years, this Ashram is a major landmark of Ahmedabad. It stands as a testimony to the efforts of Mahatma Gandhi during the pre-Independence era. The ashram today serves mainly as a museum and is divided into different sections depicting different parts of Gandhiji’s life. The exhibition consists of paintings and photos highlighting various events. You can also see some of the letters exchanged between him and other prominent personalities of the time. Along with the museum, the ashram complex houses a library, photo gallery and Hriday Kunj – Mahatma Gandhi’s cottage. It has been maintained well and exhibits many of his personal belongings, including the iconic spinning wheel. Sabarmati Ashram also has Vinobha Mira Kutir, Udyog Mandir and Upasana Mandir among other spots.</p>

                <p class="text-xl text-justify">The Riverfront has been gaining some momentum as a tourist spot for the last few years and is one of the major locations to visit if you find yourself in Ahmedabad. Now, it's not like a riverfront can just appear out of thin air, right? Sabarmati has always had a riverfront. But it was only recently that it started getting converted into something more accessible to the public. Rather, it was only recently that it was converted to a place that the public would want to access. The development of the riverfront is only a recently undertaken project, with only some parts being open to the people. But its limited nature could not stop it from being the go-to place for residents and tourists alike.</p>

                <p class="text-xl text-justify">One of the outstanding attractions of the city is the ancient Sidi Sayed Mosque located near Kalupur railway station. Sidi Sayed Mosque is a great architectural wonder built by Siddi Sayyid that gives a peak into Islamic beliefs. Visitors are inspired by the serenity of the ancient historic structure. This reputed Islamic sacred shrine is known for its architectural styles and the marvellous windows or jalis that fascinates visitors on sight and as such it is often referred to as Sidi Saiyad ni Jali. It is more prominent for the stone latticework. Lattice stone work Jali gained so much prominence that it proves to be the inspiration for the design of the logo of the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad.</p>

                <p class="text-xl text-justify">Another reason for visiting Ahmedabad or rather any city of Gujarat is the state being famous for fabrics and handicrafts. One such place in Ahmedabad which offers you all of these is Manek Chowk which is the city square. This market goes through a fabulous transformation during the day where it serves as a vegetable market in the early morning, a jewelry market through the day and turns into a food street at night. It is the second-largest jewelry market in India and you can buy your gold and silver trinkets from here during the day. After 9.30 in the night, the place turns into a food paradise. Ahmedabad was designed and planned in such a way that this square was traditionally the city-center for trading precious metals and gems. Some of the old jewelry shops of the city still exist in Manek Chowk. Though the city has taken into its stride modern day shopping avenues like malls and showrooms, Manek Chowk remains the center of Old Ahmedabad and is a favorite among locals and tourists alike for shopping.</p>
