1. The Employee details are taken as input from user, such as fields like EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Gender, Date of joining, and Hobbies
2. These fields are two way data bound to variables.
3. The variables are used to populate an object, which holds all entered data.
4. On submission, this object of Employee data is stored into an array.
5. Once the entire array is populated, all the details are then displayed into a table.
