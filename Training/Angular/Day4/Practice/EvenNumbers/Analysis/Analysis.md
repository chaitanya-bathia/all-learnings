1. This project contains a component even-numbers.
2. This component generates an array of numbers from 1 to 100 using "ngFor"
3. From this array, conditional construct will interpolate and display even numbers to the user.
4. Hence this module uses both Conditional constructs and iteratiing over a collection of data.
