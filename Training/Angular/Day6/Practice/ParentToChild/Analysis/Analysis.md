2. A variable is declared in the child component with the @Input() declaration before it.
3. This indicates that the variable is supposed to come into the component as an input from somewhere.
4. When this component is called in the parent component, the data to be send by the parent, is stored in a variable.
5. The parent component's variable is bound to the child component's variable in form of property binding in the call itself.
