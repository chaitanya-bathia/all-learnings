enum datatype creates an object that can hold multiple variables
there are 2 main types of enums: numeric and string
numeric enums have a special property, where you assign value to the first variable, all other variables' values will be incremented by 1.
the basic idea to use enums is when we need a collection of variables having unique values, but the exact values of variables are not important.
