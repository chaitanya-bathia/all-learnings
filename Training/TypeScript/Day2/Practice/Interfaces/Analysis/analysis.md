Interface is something that provides a layout for creating a class.
Like class is a blueprint for objects, Interface acts as a blueprint for creating classes.
The speciality of an interface is that attributes and methods can only be declared inside an interface.
No value can be assigned to attribute and no definition can be written for a method inside an interface.
Interface also provides a special feature called optional attribute, which can be created by adding a "?" after the name of the attribute
Optional attribute, as the name suggests, is optional and can be taken or ignored when a class is created by implementing an interface.
