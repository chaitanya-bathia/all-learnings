Functions are the simplest aspect of reusable code. a function is a piece of code that contains logic that needs to be used
again and again in a program. 
The main advantage of using functions is that we do not have to write the same repeating piece of code again and again.
Function can be declared once, defined once and called multiple times in a program.
If we want to send some data in a function for processing, it is sent as a parameter to the function.
