class is a blueprint for creating objects.
Classes define a fixed layout structure for objects.
any object belonging to a certain class is generally an instance of a said class.
all objects of a class will acquire the attributes and methods declared in the class
to initialize the values of attributes in a class, a special method called constructor is used.
constructor gets called automatically when an object gets created, and has the same name as the class
