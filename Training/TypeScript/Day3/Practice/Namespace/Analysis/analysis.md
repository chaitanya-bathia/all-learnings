Namespace is a concept created to make logical/semantic partitions of a piece of code.
Namespace creates a limited scope for variables, functions and other components that are linked logically.
Access of components in a namespace is not directly available outside a particular Namespace.
If a function xyz() is written in a namespace PQR, the only way to access that function outside the namespace is by calling it as:
PQR.xyz()
