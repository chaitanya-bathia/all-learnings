    <h1>Difference between var and let keywords</h1>
    <h3 id="sameblock">This is the case where declaration and access of variables is done in same block.</h3>
    <h3 id="newblock">This is the case where declaration and access of variables is done in different block.</h3>

    <h3>This demonstrates that "let" keyword declares variables that cannot be accessed outside the block they are declared in. But ones declared with var can be accessed anywhere.</h3>
